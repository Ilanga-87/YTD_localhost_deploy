                <h1>About Me </h1>
                   <p> Hello!
                       My name is <a href="{{ linkedin_url }}">Lika Romanova</a>, and
                    I am a novice programmer deeply in love with the world of Python.
                    This website is my personal project, created for the purpose of exploring
                    and practicing web development using Django.
                    I'm always on the lookout for new ways to enhance my programming skills.</p>

                <h3>About This Project</h3>

                <p>This site has been a practical application of the following skills:</p>
                        <p>— Utilizing the <b>Django framework</b> for Python, delving into the concept of CBVs (Class-Based Views).</p>
                        <p>— Interacting with <b>PostgreSQL</b>, one of the most popular databases.</p>
                        <p>— Implementing "deferred" tasks with <b>Celery</b>.</p>
                        <p>— Creating periodic tasks through <b>Celery beat</b>.</p>
                        <p>— Working with message brokers like <b>Redis</b> and <b>RabbitMQ</b>.</p>
                        <p>— Integrating third-party modules into my project.</p>
                        <p>— Bundling all components into a unified <b>Docker compose</b> and deploying it both <a href="{{ repo_url }}">locally</a> and on a server with a domain. </p>

                        <p>
                            I have also written a Telegram bot with similar functionality using the python-telegram-bot module.<br>
                            Bot: <a href="https://t.me/YouTube_to_AudioBot">https://t.me/YouTube_to_AudioBot</a> or @YouTube_to_AudioBot<br>

                <p>It has been an interesting and valuable experience that involved solving a range of challenges to ensure a pleasant and comfortable user interaction with the end product.</p>
